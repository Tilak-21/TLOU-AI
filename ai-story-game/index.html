THE LAST OF US: SURVIVOR STORY

The year is 2025. Over a decade has passed since the outbreak began in 2014.
What remains of humanity now hides in the shadows of a ruined world.

You are a 14-year-old survivor. The infected roam freely. Trust is scarce.

Your goal: survive.
Your tools: instinct, wit, and the will to endure.

How to play:
• Type commands like “look around”, “search backpack”, or “speak to the figure”.
• The AI reacts and shapes your story.
• Your health, energy, and age change based on your choices.
• Make it through 10+ prompts to uncover what’s left of hope.
